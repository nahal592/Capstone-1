    <h1>My Hobbies</h1>
    <h2>Tennis</h2>
    <p>
      I'm deeply passionate about tennis and aspire to become a professional
      player someday. When I'm not coding, you'll find me on the tennis court,
      enjoying matches and rounds with friends. It's not just a source of joy,
      but also an opportunity to improve my skills and experience companionship.

    <h2>Coding</h2>
    <p>
      When I'm not on the tennis court, I'm usually at home, dedicatedly coding
      and constantly honing my skills. For me, coding is an ongoing journey of
      learning and practical application, which is what I find so captivating.
      Every day, I strive to absorb new knowledge and seamlessly incorporate it
      into my routine coding practice, reflecting my genuine enthusiasm for this
      pursuit.
